//Now, in your trigger on Act: put _script=["M1"] execVM "Patrol.sqf";
//What this does is gives your _marker variable that you created in your patrol.sqf the variable to use.
//If you want multiple markers, each spawning a patrol, then just copy/paste that trigger/marker combo, then change the name of the marker and the name of the marker variable in the trigger's on act field.
//You can also spawn multiple groups from the same marker if you are interested in that. PM me for more. While I was working this out, I discovered tons of great stuff. Spawning convoys, quick reaction forces, close air support, etc., all from that same basic template.
